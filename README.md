Kingly: Fractional Real Estate Ownership on Blockchain

**Overview**
Kingly is a blockchain-based platform that facilitates fractional ownership of real estate properties. It allows property owners to tokenize their assets, breaking them into smaller, fungible tokens that represent fractional ownership. Investors can then buy, sell, or trade these tokens, providing access to the real estate market with reduced capital requirements. This README provides detailed information about the Kingly project, its requirements, setup, and usage.
